#Qunit-phantom-grunt

A short example on how to convine Qunit, PhantomJS and Gruntjs for continuos testing in Javascript.

##How to run?

First at all you must install dependencies, node and bower.
Go to the terminal and in the directory root type `bower install` and then `npm install`
Ready, you just need to start grunt, type `grunt`
Now you can develop using continuos testing, try to modify the test file fixture.js and the tests will run automatically.
